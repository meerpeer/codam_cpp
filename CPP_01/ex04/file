Sea turtles are large, air-breathing reptiles that inhabit tropical
and subtropical seas throughout the world. Their shells consist of 
an upper part (carapace) and a lower section (plastron). Hard scales 
(or scutes) cover all but the leatherback, and the number and arrangement 
of these scutes can be used to determine the species.

Sea turtles come in many different sizes, shapes and colors. The olive 
ridley is usually less than 100 pounds, while the leatherback typically 
ranges from 650 to 1,300 pounds! The upper shell, or carapace, of each 
sea turtle species ranges in length, color, shape and arrangement of scales.

Sea turtles do not have teeth, but their jaws have modified “beaks” suited 
to their particular diet. They do not have visible ears but have eardrums 
covered by skin. They hear best at low frequencies, and their sense of smell 
is excellent. Their vision underwater is good, but they are nearsighted out 
of water. Their streamlined bodies and large flippers make them remarkably 
adapted to life at sea. However, sea turtles maintain close ties to land.
